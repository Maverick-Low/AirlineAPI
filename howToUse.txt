How to use:
Each function expects a json in a specific format as indexing is used
to separate this data and query the database. Below are all the endpoints
and the expected format of the received json request.

/airline/form
{
    "dateOfDeparture": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "cityOfDeparture": "name of city",
    "cityOfArrival": "name of city",
    "tickets": integer
}

/airline/reserve
{
    "flightID": String with "01" before the actual id. E.g. "011",
    "seats": {
        "noOfEconomy": int,
        "noOfBusiness": int,
        "noOfFirstClass": int
    },
    "email" : String with "01" before the actual id. E.g. "011",
}

/airline/cancel_reservation
{"bookingID" : String with "01" before the actual id. E.g. "011,}

/airline/confirm_booking
{
    "bookingID" : String with "01" before the actual id. E.g. "011",
    "amount" : float
}

/airline/cancel_reservation
{"bookingID" : String with "01" before the actual id. E.g. "011",}


Notes:
The group decided that each airline have a 'distinguishing ID' so that the
aggregator knows which flight corresponds to each airline. For mine, this is
the '01' appended. My Flight database stores flightID's as incrementing integers
whereas, when i receive the flightID information, it is in the form of a string
which i then parse and turn into an int that is used to find the corresponding
flight. This is the same for booking ID.
